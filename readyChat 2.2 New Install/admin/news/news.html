Hello readyChat customers! We hope you have had a great start to the New Year. DesignSkate will be releasing readyChat 2.2.0 shortly with some small but worthwhile improvements to various systems such as the Chat History,
settings pages & also fixing some small bugs we managed to find. You'll also be able to see when a new update is available easily from the admin panel!
